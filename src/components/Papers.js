                        <li>Abstract: Fake news, misinformation, and news media literacy are matters of concern with the prevalence of news information across online social media platforms. This study examines the relationship between self-perceived susceptibility to misinformation and attitudes towards local politics, particularly political cynicism and political skepticism. An online survey was conducted through Qualtrics and ran from October to December 2020, sampling the Guam population. The results showed no relationship between an individual’s perceived susceptibility to misinformation and political cynicism; however, it did show that the relationship between an individual’s perceived susceptibility to misinformation was significant. This suggests that individuals with lower levels of perceived susceptibility to misinformation are more skeptical towards local politics. The results of this study also suggest the implications of susceptibility to misinformation as a component of media literacy curriculums in local schools and, in turn, how these attitudes can cultivate engagement in local politics.</li>
                        <li>This research was completed under the advisement of Dr. Francis Dalisay, PhD as part of the senior capstone course for the Communication program at the University of Guam.</li>
